# Coding Academy

This is the resources page for the coding academy

Specific lesson communications can be found in the lesson folders e.g lesson 1 stuff will be in the lesson 1 folder. This may have slide/shows or extra details. Winners of Lesson End/Test will get stars throughout the course (those with the most stars get a prize at the end of the course, perhaps ranked by grade), also students who have not missed a session will get certificates. Students who have attended 7/10 lessons will get a certificate of attendance (7/10 is a pass). 

Lessons are 1hr each, ideally 1hr 10min would be great for "assessment" at the end of each lesson. 

Learners will be required to complete an online entrance assessment before starting the course, Learners will then take the same assessment at the end of the course in order to get their certificate. (This is to track the progress of students as well as the effectiveness of the course). 

Schedule is as follows:
